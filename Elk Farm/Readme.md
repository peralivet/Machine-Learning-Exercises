## Elk farm

Your family has been managing Washington State's longest-running elk farm for several generations, but for decades the health of your herd has been slowly getting worse. It's a well known fact that your farm's breed of elk shouldn't be fed grain when average nightly temperatures are over freezing (32°F or 0°C). For that reason, you traditionally follow your grandfather's farming calendar and switch from grain feed after January 31.

You recently read about climate change affecting farming practices. Could this change explain the poorer health of your elk in recent years? With some historical weather data at your side, you seek to determine whether local temperatures are changed from your grandfather's day, and whether your farming calendar needs to be updated.
